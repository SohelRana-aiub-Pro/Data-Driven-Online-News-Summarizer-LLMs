Data-Driven-Online-News-Summarizer-LLMs
----------------------------------------

The Data Driven Online News Summarizer-ML-NLP project is designed to automate the collection,
storage, and summarization of online news articles using modern machine learning and natural
language processing (NLP) techniques. The system leverages FastAPI for web service delivery,
SQLite for lightweight data storage, and the TextRank algorithm for extractive summarization.
This project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can be applied to real-world information
streams, enabling users to consume concise summaries of complex news articles efficiently
